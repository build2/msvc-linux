@@ Had to rename Windows.h to windows.h; /showIncludes seem to retain naming
   from #include directive. Also WinBase.h, WinUser.h, WinNls.h, ... nsed?

@@ Requires bash 4, GNU sed 4.2.2 or later (-z), realpath dirpath

@@ Still need wineserver for /EP, etc. otherwise long pause.

@@ What about 64-bit? cl-64 or some such?

@@ There is link POSIX command. link.exe? cl-14.exe?

@@ The /showIncludes run is very slow most likely due to the sed-based path
   processing (but verify). Perhaps we should rewrite it in C++ with
   translated path caching, etc.
